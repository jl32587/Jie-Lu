# NGS data analysis tools for small RNA-seq in plants

Small RNAs are 20-30nt long nucleic acids that negatively regulate gene expression/translation. In plants, two major classesof endogenous small RNAs play important roles in post-transcriptional regulation and genome stability maintenance. The 21-nt-long small RNAs are mostly microRNAs which guide target-specific mRNA cleavage. The 24-nt-long small RNAs are generated fromtransposable element-rich regions in the genome and mediate heterochromatin formation and maintenance. 

Next generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled comprehensive
profiling of small RNA populations in plant genomes. This collection of small
RNA-seq analysis tools were developed specifically for the output from CASHX (https://omictools.com/cache-assisted-hash-search-with-xor-logic-tool).
